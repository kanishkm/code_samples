Notes / Assumptions

1)The server program binds to ip localhost and port 50000. Clients connect to the same. This is not configurable at either end. 
2) Only single moves can be made during the game, i.e. no double jumps are allowed.
3)Capturing Moves are given preference to non- capturing moves. If a capturing move is available, the server will only suggest that to the player. If no capturing moves are available, then only will a non- capturing move be suggested by the server.
4)The current board information is sent to both players after every move, but the available moves information is only sent to the player, whose turn it is. 
5)The moves are presented as a list, with numbers in front of them. The clients can enter any of the numbers, to make a move.
6)Not all error cases have been handled, and commenting has been kept minimal due to time constraints.
